Horiseon html and css have a few mistake hidden in the code
Horiseon code comes from coding bootcamp challenge. 
html and css already set but has a few minor mistake/correction to make webpage cleaner

## what I updated on html
On <!--div class="content"-->
div id="search-engine-otimization" was missing and would not redirct when you click on header.

## what I updated on CSS
quotation was missing on font-family: 'Calibri' on .header div {}, .benefits {}, .online-reputation-management {}, and .social-media-marketing {}.

Added text-align: center to benfit section to center paragraphs for cleaner look.
