# fix-horiseon-code

Horiseon html and css have a few mistake hidden in the code
    Horiseon code comes from coding bootcamp challenge. 
    when I view the source code I notice minor problems with the html and css.


## what I updated on html

On <!--div class="content"-->
    div id="search-engine-otimization" was missing and would not redirct when you click on header.

## what I updated on CSS

quotation was missing on font-family: 'Calibri' on .header div {}, .benefits {}, .online-reputation-management {}, and .social-media-marketing {}.

    Added text-align: center to benfit section to center paragraphs for cleaner look.

    title shown as webpage, changed to Horiseon to match header 
    
    rearrange CSS styling for a cleaner look. 
    all comments are left in the code.
